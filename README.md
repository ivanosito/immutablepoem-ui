# ✍️ ImmutablePoem UI

A minimalist Web3 frontend for publishing, reading, and rating poems — stored immutably on a local Hardhat blockchain.

This project is the frontend companion to the `ImmutablePoem` smart contract — a fully functional Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating how decentralized literature could work in a world where code and poetry meet.
